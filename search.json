Kogelheide\nPhD Student in Social Data Science\nInstitute of Employment Research\nUniversity of Mannheim\nluca.kogelheide[at]iab[dot]de\n\n\nAbout\nI am a quantitative methodologist fascinated by how we can reliably measure social and behavioral phenomena. Driven by the conviction that meaningful empirical research should be as rigorous and trustworthy as the public expects it to be, I am dedicated to fostering an open, transparent, and methodologically robust research culture in the social sciences. Working at the intersection of statistics and survey methodology, my research is guided by a commitment to strengthening the credibility of empirical findings through rigorous analytic approaches and high-quality data.\nMy own research focuses on survey statistics and data quality, with a current focus on improving longitudinal labor market panel data. I currently pursue a PhD in Social Data Science & Research Methodology at the University of Mannheim and the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). I hold a Research Master’s in Statistics and Methodology, with a specialization in official statistics, including the European Master of Official Statistics, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Witten/Herdecke.\n\n\n\n\nInterests\n\n(Panel) Survey Methodology\nData Quality\nOfficial Statistics\nOpen Science\nPhilosophy of Statistics & Social Science\n\n\n\nEducation\n PhD in Social Data Science (ongoing) Institute for Employment Research (IAB) & University of Mannheim\n Research Master in Statistics and Methodology (European Master in Official Statistics) 2023–2025 Utrecht University (Statistics Netherlands)\n University of Witten/Herdecke"
