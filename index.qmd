### About

I am a *quantitative methodologist* fascinated by how we can reliably measure social and behavioral phenomena. Driven by the conviction that meaningful empirical research should be as *rigorous* and *trustworthy* as the public expects it to be, I am dedicated to fostering an open, transparent, and methodologically robust research culture in the social sciences. Working at the intersection of *statistics* and *survey methodology*, my research is guided by a commitment to strengthening the credibility of empirical findings through rigorous analytic approaches and high-quality data.  
My own research focuses on *survey statistics* and *data quality*, with a current focus on improving longitudinal labor market panel data. I currently pursue a *PhD in Social Data Science & Research Methodology* at the University of Mannheim and the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). I hold a Research Master’s in Statistics and Methodology, with a specialization in official statistics, including the European Master of Official Statistics, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Witten/Herdecke.
